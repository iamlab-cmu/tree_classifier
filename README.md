## Setup Instructions

This guide will help you set up a Python environment for this project and install all required dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects or system packages.

#### For Windows:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### For macOS/Linux:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies

Once your virtual environment is activated (you should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command line), install the required packages:

```bash
# Install all requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If the `requirements.txt` file does not exist yet, you can generate it by running:

```bash
# Install pipreqs if not already installed
pip install pipreqs

# Generate requirements.txt
pipreqs .
```

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Package not found errors**: Make sure your virtual environment is activated before installing packages.
2. **Python version conflicts**: Verify you're using a compatible Python version.
3. **Permission errors**: On Linux/macOS, you might need to use `sudo` for global installations or fix directory permissions.
